OMB (OSU Micro-Benchmarks)
--------------------------
The OSU Micro-Benchmarks use the GNU build system.  Therefore you can simply
use the following steps if mpicc or oshcc is in your PATH.

Example:
	./configure
	make
	make install

If your compiler is not in your path or you would like to use another
particular version you can tell configure by setting CC.

Example:
	./configure CC=/path/to/mpicc
	make
	make install

Configure will detect whether your library supports MPI-1, MPI-2, and OpenSHMEM
to compile the corresponding benchmarks.  See
http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/ to download the latest version of
this package.

This package also distributes UPC put and get benchmarks.  These are located in
the upc subdirectory and can be compiled by the following:

        upcc upc/osu_upc_memput.c -o upc/osu_upc_memput
        upcc upc/osu_upc_memget.c -o upc/osu_upc_memget

The MPI Multiple Bandwidth / Message Rate (osu_mbw_mr), OpenSHMEM Put Message
Rate (osu_oshm_put_mr), and OpenSHMEM Atomics (osu_oshm_atomics) tests are
intended to be used with block assigned ranks.  This means that all processes
on the same machine are assigned ranks sequentially.

Rank	Block   Cyclic
----------------------
0	host1	host1
1	host1	host2
2	host1	host1
3	host1	host2
4	host2	host1
5	host2	host2
6	host2	host1
7	host2	host2

If you're using mpirun_rsh the ranks are assigned in the order they are seen in
the hostfile or on the command line.  Please see your process managers'
documentation for information on how to control the distribution of the rank to
host mapping.

Point-to-Point MPI Benchmarks
-----------------------------

osu_latency - Latency Test
    * The latency tests are carried out in a ping-pong fashion. The sender
    * sends a message with a certain data size to the receiver and waits for a
    * reply from the receiver. The receiver receives the message from the sender
    * and sends back a reply with the same data size. Many iterations of this
    * ping-pong test are carried out and average one-way latency numbers are
    * obtained. Blocking version of MPI functions (MPI_Send and MPI_Recv) are
    * used in the tests. This test is available here.

osu_latency_mt - Multi-threaded Latency Test
    * The multi-threaded latency test performs a ping-pong test with a single
    * sender process and multiple threads on the receiving process. In this test
    * the sending process sends a message of a given data size to the receiver
    * and waits for a reply from the receiver process. The receiving process has
    * a variable number of receiving threads (set by default to 2), where each
    * thread calls MPI_Recv and upon receiving a message sends back a response
    * of equal size. Many iterations are performed and the average one-way
    * latency numbers are reported. This test is available here.

osu_bw - Bandwidth Test
    * The bandwidth tests were carried out by having the sender sending out a
    * fixed number (equal to the window size) of back-to-back messages to the
    * receiver and then waiting for a reply from the receiver. The receiver
    * sends the reply only after receiving all these messages. This process is
    * repeated for several iterations and the bandwidth is calculated based on
    * the elapsed time (from the time sender sends the first message until the
    * time it receives the reply back from the receiver) and the number of bytes
    * sent by the sender. The objective of this bandwidth test is to determine
    * the maximum sustained date rate that can be achieved at the network level.
    * Thus, non-blocking version of MPI functions (MPI_Isend and MPI_Irecv) were
    * used in the test. This test is available here.

osu_bibw - Bidirectional Bandwidth Test
    * The bidirectional bandwidth test is similar to the bandwidth test, except
    * that both the nodes involved send out a fixed number of back-to-back
    * messages and wait for the reply. This test measures the maximum
    * sustainable aggregate bandwidth by two nodes. This test is available here.

osu_mbw_mr - Multiple Bandwidth / Message Rate Test
    * The multi-pair bandwidth and message rate test evaluates the aggregate
    * uni-directional bandwidth and message rate between multiple pairs of
    * processes. Each of the sending processes sends a fixed number of messages
    * (the window size) back-to-back to the paired receiving process before
    * waiting for a reply from the receiver. This process is repeated for
    * several iterations. The objective of this benchmark is to determine the
    * achieved bandwidth and message rate from one node to another node with a
    * configurable number of processes running on each node. The test is
    * available here.

osu_multi_lat - Multi-pair Latency Test (requires threading support from MPI-2)
    * This test is very similar to the latency test. However, at the same 
    * instant multiple pairs are performing the same test simultaneously.
    * In order to perform the test across just two nodes the hostnames must
    * be specified in block fashion.

Collective Latency Tests
    * The latest OMB Version includes benchmarks for various MPI collective
    * operations (MPI_Allgather, MPI_Alltoall, MPI_Allreduce, MPI_Barrier,
    * MPI_Bcast, MPI_Gather, MPI_Reduce, MPI_Reduce_Scatter, MPI_Scatter and
    * vector collectives). These benchmarks work in the following manner.
    * Suppose users run the osu_bcast benchmark with N processes, the benchmark
    * measures the min, max and the average latency of the MPI_Bcast collective
    * operation across N processes, for various message lengths, over a large
    * number of iterations. In the default version, these benchmarks report the
    * average latency for each message length. Additionally, the benchmarks
    * offer the following options:
    * "-f" can be used to report additional statistics of the benchmark,
           such as min and max latencies and the number of iterations.
    * "-m" option can be used to set the maximum message length to be used in a
           benchmark. In the default version, the benchmarks report the
           latencies for up to 1MB message lengths.
    * "-i" can be used to set the number of iterations to run for each message
           length.

One-sided MPI Benchmarks
------------------------

osu_put_latency - Latency Test for Put with Active Synchronization
    * Post-Wait/Start-Complete synchronization is used in this test. The origin
    * process calls MPI_Put to directly place data of a certain size in the
    * remote process's window. It waits on the MPI_Win_complete call to ensure
    * the local completion of the message. The target process calls
    * MPI_Win_wait to make sure the message has been received in its window.
    * Then the origin and target are interchanged and the communication happens
    * in the opposite direction.  Several iterations of this test is carried
    * out and the average put latency numbers is obtained. The latency includes
    * the synchronization time. By default, the window memory is allocated in
    * shared memory by providing 'alloc_shm' hint to MPI_Alloc_mem call. This
    * hint is specific to MVAPICH2 and is ignored by other MPI libraries.
    * MVAPICH2 takes advantage of this to optimize intra-node one-sided
    * communication. It does not have an impact on internode performance. This
    * optimization can be disabled by providing '-n' or '-no-hints' option to
    * the benchmark.

osu_get_latency - Latency Test for Get with Active Synchronization
    * Post-Wait/Start-Complete synchronization is used in this test. The origin
    * process calls MPI_Get to directly fetch data of a certain size from the
    * target process's window into a local buffer. It then waits on a
    * synchronization call (MPI_Win_complete) for local completion of the Gets.
    * The remote process waits on a MPI_Win_wait call. After the
    * synchronization calls, the target and origin process are switched for a
    * message in the opposite direction.  Several iterations of this test are
    * carried out and the average get latency numbers is obtained. The latency
    * includes the synchronization time. By default, the window memory is
    * allocated in shared memory by providing 'alloc_shm' hint to MPI_Alloc_mem
    * call. This hint is specific to MVAPICH2 and is ignored by other MPI
    * libraries. MVAPICH2 takes advantage of this to optimize intra-node
    * one-sided communication. It does not have an impact on internode
    * performance. This optimization can be disabled by providing '-n' or
    * '-no-hints' option to the benchmark. 

osu_put_bw - Bandwidth Test for Put with Active Synchronization
    * Post-Wait/Start-Complete synchronization is used in this test. The test
    * is carried out by the origin process calling a fixed number of
    * back-to-back MPI_Puts on remote window and then waiting on a
    * synchronization call (MPI_Win_complete) for their completion. The remote
    * process participates in synchronization with MPI_Win_post and
    * MPI_Win_wait calls. This process is repeated for several iterations and
    * the bandwidth is calculated based on the elapsed time and the number of
    * bytes put by the origin process.  By default, the window memory is
    * allocated in shared memory by providing 'alloc_shm' hint to MPI_Alloc_mem
    * call. This hint is specific to MVAPICH2 and is ignored by other MPI
    * libraries. MVAPICH2 takes advantage of this to optimize intra-node
    * one-sided communication. It does not have an impact on internode
    * performance. This optimization can be disabled by providing '-n' or
    * '-no-hints' option to the benchmark. 

osu_get_bw - Bandwidth Test for Get with Active Synchronization
    * Post-Wait/Start-Complete synchronization is used in this test. The test
    * is carried out by origin process calling a fixed number of back-to-back
    * MPI_Gets and then waiting on a synchronization call (MPI_Win_complete)
    * for their completion. The remote process participates in synchronization
    * with MPI_Win_post and MPI_Win_wait calls. This process is repeated for
    * several iterations and the bandwidth is calculated based on the elapsed
    * time and the number of bytes received by the origin process. By default,
    * the window memory is allocated in shared memory by providing 'alloc_shm'
    * hint to MPI_Alloc_mem call. This hint is specific to MVAPICH2 and is
    * ignored by other MPI libraries.  MVAPICH2 takes advantage of this to
    * optimize intra-node one-sided communication.  It does not have an impact
    * on internode performance. This optimization can be disabled by providing
    * '-n' or '-no-hints' option to the benchmark. 

osu_put_bibw - Bi-directional Bandwidth Test for Put with Active Synchronization
    * Post-Wait/Start-Complete synchronization is used in this test. This test
    * is similar to the bandwidth test, except that both the processes involved
    * send out a fixed number of back-to-back MPI_Puts and wait for their
    * completion.  This test measures the maximum sustainable aggregate
    * bandwidth by two processes. By default, the window memory is allocated in
    * shared memory by providing 'alloc_shm' hint to MPI_Alloc_mem call. This
    * hint is specific to MVAPICH2 and is ignored by other MPI libraries.
    * MVAPICH2 takes advantage of this to optimize intra-node one-sided
    * communication. It does not have an impact on internode performance. This
    * optimization can be disabled by providing '-n' or '-no-hints' option to
    * the benchmark. 

osu_acc_latency - Latency Test for Accumulate with Active Synchronization
    * Post-Wait/Start-Complete synchronization is used in this test. The origin
    * process calls MPI_Accumulate to combine data from the local buffer with
    * the data in the remote window and store it in the remote window. The
    * combining operation used in the test is MPI_SUM. The origin process then
    * waits on a synchronization call (MPI_Win_complete) for local completion
    * of the operations.  The remote process waits on a MPI_Win_wait call.
    * After the synchronization call, the target and origin process are
    * switched for the pong message. Several iterations of this test are
    * carried out and the average accumulate latency number is obtained. The
    * latency includes the synchronization time. By default, the window memory
    * is allocated in shared memory by providing 'alloc_shm' hint to
    * MPI_Alloc_mem call. This hint is specific to MVAPICH2 and is ignored by
    * other MPI libraries. MVAPICH2 takes advantage of this to optimize
    * intra-node one-sided communication. It does not have an impact on
    * internode performance. This optimization can be disabled by providing
    * '-n' or '-no-hints' option to the benchmark. 

osu_passive_put_latency - Latency Test for Put with Passive Synchronization
    * The origin process calls MPI_Win_lock to lock the target process's window
    * and calls MPI_Put to directly place data of certain size in the window.
    * Then it calls MPI_Win_unlock to ensure completion of the Put and release
    * lock on the window. This is carried out for several iterations and the
    * average time for MPI_Lock + MPI_Put + MPI_Unlock calls is measured.  By
    * default, the window memory is allocated in shared memory by providing
    * 'alloc_shm' hint to MPI_Alloc_mem call. This optimization is specific to
    * MVAPICH2 and the hint is ignored by other MPI libraries. It does not have
    * an impact on internode performance. This optimization can be disabled by
    * providing '-n' or '-no-hints' option to the benchmark. 

osu_passive_get_latency - Latency Test for Get with Passive Synchronization
    * The origin process calls MPI_Win_lock to lock the target process's window
    * and calls MPI_Get to directly read data of certain size from the window.
    * Then it calls MPI_Win_unlock to ensure completion of the Get and releases
    * lock on remote window. This is carried out for several iterations and the
    * average time for MPI_Lock + MPI_Get + MPI_Unlock calls is measured.  By
    * default, the window memory is allocated in shared memory by providing
    * 'alloc_shm' hint to MPI_Alloc_mem call. This optimization is specific to
    * MVAPICH2 and the hint is ignored by other MPI libraries. It does not have
    * an impact on internode performance. This optimization can be disabled by

    * Puts and release lock on remote window. This process is repeated for
    * several iterations and the bandwidth is calculated based on the elapsed
    * time and the number of bytes put by the origin process. By default, the
    * window memory is allocated in shared memory by providing 'alloc_shm' hint
    * to MPI_Alloc_mem call. This optimization is specific to MVAPICH2 and the
    * hint is ignored by other MPI libraries. It does not have an impact on
    * internode performance. This optimization can be disabled by providing
    * '-n' or '-no-hints' option to the benchmark.

osu_passive_get_bw - Bandwidth Test for Get with Passive Synchronization
    * The origin process calls MPI_Win_lock to lock the target process's window
    * and calls a fixed number of back-to-back MPI_Gets to directly get data
    * from the window. Then it calls MPI_Win_unlock to ensure completion of the
    * Gets and release lock on the window. This process is repeated for several
    * iterations and the bandwidth is calculated based on the elapsed time and
    * the number of bytes read by the origin process. By default, the window
    * memory is allocated in shared memory by providing 'alloc_shm' hint to

OpenSHMEM Benchmarks
--------------------

osu_oshm_put.c - Latency Test for OpenSHMEM Put Routine
    * This benchmark measures latency of a shmem putmem operation for different
    * data sizes. The user is required to select whether the communication
    * buffers should be allocated in global memory or heap memory, through a
    * parameter. The test requires exactly two PEs. PE 0 issues shmem putmem to
    * write data at PE 1 and then calls shmem quiet. This is repeated for a
    * fixed number of iterations, depending on the data size. The average
    * latency per iteration is reported. A few warm-up iterations are run
    * without timing to ignore any start-up overheads.  Both PEs call shmem
    * barrier all after the test for each message size.

osu_oshm_get.c - Latency Test for OpenSHMEM Get Routine
    * This benchmark is similar to the one above except that PE 0 does a shmem
    * getmem operation to read data from PE 1 in each iteration. The average
    * latency per iteration is reported.

osu_oshm_put_mr.c - Message Rate Test for OpenSHMEM Put Routine
    * This benchmark measures the aggregate uni-directional operation rate of
    * OpenSHMEM Put between pairs of PEs, for different data sizes. The user
    * should select for communication buffers to be in global memory and heap
    * memory as with the earlier benchmarks. This test requires number of PEs
    * to be even. The PEs are paired with PE 0 pairing with PE n/2 and so on,
    * where n is the total number of PEs. The first PE in each pair issues
    * back-to-back shmem putmem operations to its peer PE. The total time for
    * the put operations is measured and operation rate per second is reported.
    * All PEs call shmem barrier all after the test for each message size.

osu_oshm_atomics.c - Latency and Operation Rate Test for OpenSHMEM Atomics Routines
    * This benchmark measures the performance of atomic fetch-and-operate and
    * atomic operate routines sup- ported in OpenSHMEM for the integer
    * datatype. The buffers can be selected to be in heap memory or global
    * memory. The PEs are paired like in the case of Put Operation Rate
    * benchmark and the first PE in each pair issues back-to-back atomic
    * operations of a type to its peer PE. The average latency per atomic
    * operation and the aggregate operation rate are reported.  This is
    * repeated for each of fadd, finc, add, inc, cswap and swap routines.

UPC Benchmarks
--------------
osu_upc_memput.c - Put Latency
    * This benchmark measures the latency of upc put operation between multiple
    * UPC threads. In this bench- mark, UPC threads with ranks less than
    * (THREADS/2) issues upc memput operations to peer UPC threads. Peer
    * threads are identified as (MYTHREAD+THREADS/2). This is repeated for a
    * fixed number of iterations, for varying data sizes. The average latency
    * per iteration is reported. A few warm-up iterations are run without
    * timing to ignore any start-up overheads. All UPC threads call upc barrier
    * after the test for each message size.

osu_upc_memget.c - Get Latency
    * This benchmark is similar as the osu upc put benchmark that is described
    * above. The difference is that the shared string handling function is upc
    * memget. The average get operation latency per iteration is reported.


CUDA Extensions to OMB
----------------------
CUDA Extensions to OMB can be enable by configuring the benchmark suite with
--enable-cuda option as shown below. The MPI library used should be able to
support MPI_Send/MPI_Recv from buffers in GPU Device memory. 

    ./configure CC=/path/to/mpicc 
                --enable-cuda 
                --with-cuda-include=/path/to/cuda/include
                --with-cuda-lib=/path/to/cuda/lib
    make
    make install

The following benchmarks have been extended to evaluate performance of
MPI_Send/MPI_Recv from and to buffers on NVIDIA GPU devices. 

    osu_bibw    - Bidirectional Bandwidth Test
    osu_bw      - Bandwidth Test
    osu_latency - Latency Test

These extensions are enabled when the benchmark suite is configured with
--enable-cuda option, as shown above. Whether a process allocates its
communication buffers on the GPU device or on the host can be controlled at
run-time.

Each of these benchmarks takes two input parameters. The first parameter
indicates the location of the buffers at rank 0 and the second parameter
indicates the location of the buffers at rank 1. The value of each of these
parameters can be either 'H' or 'D' to indicate if the buffers are to be on the
host or on the device respectively. When no parameters are specified, the
buffers are allocated on the host.

Examples:

    - mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile hostfile MV2_USE_CUDA=1 osu_latency D D 
    
In this run, the latency test allocates buffers at both rank 0 and rank 1 on
the GPU devices.

    - mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile hostfile MV2_USE_CUDA=1 osu_bw D H

In this run, the bandwidth test allocates buffers at rank 0 on the GPU device
and buffers at rank 1 on the host.

Setting GPU affinity
--------------------
GPU affinity for processes should be set before MPI_Init is called.  The
process rank on a node is normally used to do this and different MPI launchers
expose this information through different environment variables. The benchmarks
use an environment variable called LOCAL_RANK to get this information. 

A script like below can be used to export this environment variable when using
mpirun_rsh.  This can be adapted to work with other MPI launchers and
libraries.

    #!/bin/bash

    export LOCAL_RANK=$MV2_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK
    exec $*

A copy of this script is installed as get_local_rank alongside the benchmarks.
It can be used as follows: 

    mpirun_rsh -np 2 -hostfile hostfile MV2_USE_CUDA=1 get_local_rank ./osu_latency D D
