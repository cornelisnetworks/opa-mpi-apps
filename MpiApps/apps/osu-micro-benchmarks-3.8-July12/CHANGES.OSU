OSU Micro Benchmarks v3.5.1 (2/02/12)
* New Features & Enhancements
    - Provide script to set GPU affinity for MPI processes
* Bug Fixes
    - Removed GPU binding after MPI_Init to avoid switching context

OSU Micro Benchmarks v3.5 (11/09/11)
* New Features & Enhancements
    - Extension of osu_latency, osu_bw, and osu_bibw benchmarks to evaluate the
      performance of MPI_Send/MPI_Recv operation with NVIDIA GPU device and
      CUDA support
        - This functionality is exposed when configured with --enable-cuda
          option
    - Flexibility for using buffers in NVIDIA GPU device (D) and host memory (H)
    - Flexibility for selecting data movement between D->D, D->H and H->D

OSU Micro Benchmarks v3.4 (09/13/11)
* New Features & Enhancements
    - Add passive one-sided communication benchmarks
    - Update one-sided communication benchmarks to provide shared memory hint
      in MPI_Alloc_mem calls
    - Update one-sided communication benchmarks to use MPI_Alloc_mem for buffer
      allocation
    - Give default values to configure definitions (can now build directly with
      mpicc)
    - Update latency benchmarks to begin from 0 byte message
* Bug Fixes
    - Remove memory leaks in one-sided communication benchmarks
    - Update benchmarks to touch buffers before using them for communication
    - Fix osu_get_bw test to use different buffers for concurrent communication
      operations
    - Fix compilation warnings
